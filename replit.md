# Aeturnis Online - Project Documentation

## Overview

This is a comprehensive documentation repository for Aeturnis Online, a full-scale MMORPG project. The repository contains extensive documentation, methodologies, and project management resources following a sophisticated development framework called CAFE (Contract-First, AI-Facilitated Engineering).

**My Role**: Frontend Specialist under CAFE v2.0 Division Protocol
- Own all UI/UX implementation
- Create React components and views
- Handle client-side state management
- Implement responsive design
- Manage client-side performance

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
DO NOT CODE anything without explicit instructions - user has their own plans.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Stack (My Responsibility)
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS (Emotion/Styled Components)
- **Bundler**: Vite
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

### Package Management
- **Yarn**: Primary package manager (NOT npm)
- All commands should use `yarn` instead of `npm`

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Provisioned and ready for use
- Environment variables available: DATABASE_URL, PGPORT, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD, PGDATABASE, PGHOST

## Key Components

### Entry Point
- **main.py**: Serves as the primary executable file that validates the development environment is functional
- Purpose: Provides a minimal starting point for Python development
- Functionality: Prints a confirmation message when executed

## Data Flow

Currently, there is no data flow as the application only outputs a static message. The architecture is prepared to be extended with:
- Input/output handling
- Data processing logic
- External service interactions

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies are currently defined. The repository uses only Python standard library functionality.

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for Replit environment deployment:
- Uses Python 3 as the runtime environment
- Minimal resource requirements
- Ready for incremental development and feature addition

## Development Notes

This repository appears to be a blank slate or starter template, ready for:
- Framework integration (Flask, FastAPI, Django, etc.)
- Database integration (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- API development
- Frontend integration
- Authentication systems
- Third-party service integrations

The current architecture allows for flexible expansion in any direction based on project requirements.
