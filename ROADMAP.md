- Open Alpha: October 15, 2025

---

## Phase 3: Beta - Advanced Features

**Target**: 25+ systems | **Timeline**: November 2025 - January 2026  
**Focus**: Endgame content, crafting, advanced systems

### November 2025 (Endgame Systems)

- Achievement System
- Gem System & Enchanting
- Crafting Professions
- Instance/Dungeon System

### December 2025 (Social & Economy)

- Clan System (full implementation)
- Kingdom System
- Advanced Trading
- Housing System

### January 2026 (Polish & Launch Prep)

- AI Integration (Ollama)
- Marriage System
- Pet System
- Final optimization

**Beta Milestones**:

- Closed Beta: November 1, 2025
- Open Beta: December 15, 2025
- Release Candidate: January 20, 2026

---

## Phase 4: Release

**Target Date**: February 1, 2026  
**Launch Features**:

- 100+ hours of content
- 6 races (+ 4 special reincarnation races)
- 8 classes with full skill trees
- 20+ zones with level progression
- Complete PvP and PvE systems
- Full social features and economy

---

## Critical Path Dependencies

1. **Banking MUST come before Death System** (death penalty requires banking)
2. **Account Management before Character Creation** (characters need accounts)
3. **Combat Engine before NPCs/AI** (AI needs combat system)
4. **Items before Equipment/Inventory** (foundation for item management)
5. **Zones before Travel System** (need places to travel between)

## Risk Factors & Velocity

### Current Velocity

- **Achieved**: 6 systems in 2 days = 3 systems/day
- **Required**: 26 systems in 48 days = 0.54 systems/day
- **Buffer**: 5.5x faster than required

### Adjusted Timeline (Conservative)

If velocity drops to 1 system/day:

- MVP Complete: August 5, 2025 (3 weeks early)
- Alpha Complete: September 20, 2025 (1 week early)
- Beta Complete: December 25, 2025 (4 weeks early)

### Risk Mitigation

- Front-load critical systems (Banking, Death, Combat)
- Implement MVP systems before nice-to-haves
- Keep 20% time buffer for testing/polish
- Prioritize systems that block others
