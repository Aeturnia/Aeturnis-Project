## Critical Path Dependencies (Per Implementation Plan v5.0)

```
[P1-S1] Foundation & Infrastructure
    ‚Üì
[P1-S2] Account & Character System
    ‚Üì
[P1-S3] Items, Equipment & Inventory
    ‚Üì
[P1-S4] Combat System & Mechanics
    ‚Üì
[P1-S5] NPCs & Basic AI
    ‚Üì
[P1-S6] Loot & Economy Foundation
    ‚Üì
[P1-S7] Banking & Death System (depends on loot/economy)
    ‚Üì
[P1-S8] Zone System & World (depends on NPCs and Death)
```

**Note**: Banking is NOT a critical early system. It depends on having:

- Loot system (to generate gold to bank)
- Economy foundation (to understand currency)
- Items (to allow item banking)

## Risk Factors & Velocity

### Current Velocity

- **Achieved**: 6 systems in 2 days = 3 systems/day
- **Required**: 26 systems in 79 days = 0.33 systems/day
- **Buffer**: 9x faster than required

### Adjusted Timeline (Conservative)

If velocity drops to 1 system/day:

- MVP Complete: August 20, 2025 (5 weeks early)
- Alpha Complete: October 15, 2025 (2 weeks early)
- Beta Complete: January 15, 2026 (6 weeks early)

### Risk Mitigation

- Follow Implementation Plan v5.0 dependency order
- Complete foundation systems before features
- Maintain 90%+ test coverage
- Keep 20% time buffer for testing/polish

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (MVP)

- ‚úÖ All 32 core systems operational
- ‚úÖ 90%+ test coverage maintained
- ‚úÖ <200ms API response times
- ‚úÖ Support 1,000 concurrent players

### Phase 2 (Alpha)

- ‚úÖ Group content functional
- ‚úÖ PvP system balanced
- ‚úÖ Economy stable (no inflation)
- ‚úÖ Support 5,000 concurrent players

### Phase 3 (Beta)

- ‚úÖ All content complete
- ‚úÖ <1% crash rate
- ‚úÖ Endgame progression working
- ‚úÖ Support 10,000 concurrent players

### Phase 4 (Release)

- ‚úÖ 99.9% uptime
- ‚úÖ All monetization systems operational
- ‚úÖ Support 50,000+ concurrent players
- ‚úÖ Positive player reviews

**Updated by**: Claude Code  
**Based on**: aeturnis-implementation-plan.md v5.0  
**Next Update**: After Monitoring & Logging implementation

**IMPORTANT**: This roadmap now follows the Implementation Plan v5.0 dependency
order. Banking is no longer prioritized early as it depends on having Loot &
Economy systems first.
