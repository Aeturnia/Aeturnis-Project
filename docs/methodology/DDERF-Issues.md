## Active Issues

### [DDERF-001] Missing Directory Structure Commits

- **Detected**: 2025-07-13 via audit report for [P1-S1-1]
- **Catalog Tag**: [P1-S1-1]
- **Error Type**: TYPE-H (Implementation Gaps)
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: Resolved

#### 1. Detect

Audit report shows controllers/, middleware/, and repositories/ directories are
not committed to version control despite being documented in architecture
overview.

#### 2. Diagnose

Git doesn't track empty directories. The implementation created the folders but
didn't add .gitkeep files or placeholder content.

#### 3. Explain

During scaffolding, `mkdir` commands created the directory structure, but
without files inside them, Git ignored these folders. This breaks the stated
Controller → Service → Repository architecture pattern.

#### 4. Resolve

Add .gitkeep files or minimal placeholder files to all empty directories to
ensure the complete directory skeleton is tracked in version control.

#### 5. Fix

- Added .gitkeep files to controllers/, middleware/, and repositories/
  directories
- Created controller stubs for all services (auth, banking, character, combat,
  pk)
- All directories now tracked in version control

**Resolution Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Fixed in Version**: Server v1.0.0

### [DDERF-002] No Repository Layer Abstractions

- **Detected**: 2025-07-13 via audit report for [P1-S1-1]
- **Catalog Tag**: [P1-S1-1]
- **Error Type**: TYPE-B (Business Logic Violations)
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: Open

#### 1. Detect

Services are set up to call Prisma directly without repository layer
abstraction, violating the documented architecture pattern.

#### 2. Diagnose

Repository interfaces were not created during the architecture implementation,
only the directory structure was planned.

#### 3. Explain

Without repository abstractions, services are tightly coupled to Prisma ORM,
making testing harder and future database changes more difficult.

#### 4. Resolve

Create interface-based repository classes for each model (AccountRepository,
CharacterRepository, etc.) that wrap Prisma client calls.

#### 5. Fix

[Pending implementation]

### [DDERF-003] Missing Express Bootstrap

- **Detected**: 2025-07-13 via audit report for [P1-S1-1]
- **Catalog Tag**: [P1-S1-1]
- **Error Type**: TYPE-H (Implementation Gaps)
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: Resolved

#### 1. Detect

The src/index.ts file only contains console.log statements, no Express server
setup despite architecture documentation referencing it.

#### 2. Diagnose

Initial implementation focused on type definitions and structure but didn't
implement the actual Express application bootstrap.

#### 3. Explain

Without Express setup, the server cannot start, routes cannot be registered, and
the CI pipeline cannot verify a working server.

#### 4. Resolve

Update src/index.ts with minimal Express setup including app initialization,
router registration, and health endpoint.

#### 5. Fix

- Implemented Express server with standard middleware (helmet, cors, morgan)
- Added /health endpoint returning server status and version
- Added /api/v1 endpoint listing available API routes
- Implemented global error handler and 404 handler
- Server now starts on PORT (default 3000)

**Resolution Date**: 2025-07-13  
**Fixed in Version**: Server v1.0.0

### [DDERF-004] Missing Security Middleware

- **Detected**: 2025-07-13 via audit report for [P1-S1-1]
- **Catalog Tag**: [P1-S1-1]
- **Error Type**: TYPE-J (Security Vulnerabilities)
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: Open

#### 1. Detect

No middleware implementations exist for authentication, validation, or rate
limiting despite being documented in constants and architecture.

#### 2. Diagnose

Middleware directory was created but no actual middleware files were implemented
during architecture scaffolding.

#### 3. Explain

Missing middleware creates security gaps - no JWT verification, no input
validation, no rate limiting protection against abuse.

#### 4. Resolve

Implement middleware skeletons for auth (JWT verification), validation (Zod
schemas), and rate limiting using the defined constants.

#### 5. Fix

[Pending implementation]

### [DDERF-005] Architecture Files Lack Tests

- **Detected**: 2025-07-13 via pnpm test coverage report showing 2.2% coverage
- **Catalog Tag**: [P1-S1-1]
- **Error Type**: TYPE-H (Implementation Gaps)
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: Open

#### 1. Detect

Server test coverage dropped from 91.66% to 2.2% after architecture
implementation. All new files have 0% coverage.

#### 2. Diagnose

Architecture implementation added many new files but no corresponding unit tests
were created.

#### 3. Explain

The 90% coverage requirement is now violated. New files (services, types,
routes, events) need test coverage to maintain quality standards.

#### 4. Resolve

Write unit tests for constants, event bus, type definitions, and service
placeholders to restore coverage above 90%.

#### 5. Fix

[Pending implementation]

### [DDERF-006] Test Data Foreign Key Constraint Violations

- **Detected**: 2025-07-13 via CI pipeline failure after coverage threshold
  adjustment
- **Catalog Tag**: N/A (pre-existing test issue)
- **Error Type**: TYPE-D (Data Flow Problems)
- **Severity**: High
- **Status**: Open

#### 1. Detect

Multiple test failures with PostgreSQL foreign key constraint violations:

- Character creation fails: violates foreign key constraint
  "Character_accountId_fkey"
- Transaction creation fails: violates foreign key constraint
  "Transaction_bankAccountId_fkey"
- XpLedger creation fails: violates foreign key constraint
  "XpLedger_characterId_fkey"
- PkKillLog creation fails: violates foreign key constraint
  "PkKillLog_attackerId_fkey"

#### 2. Diagnose

Tests are attempting to create child records (Character, Transaction, etc.)
without first creating the required parent records (Account, BankAccount). The
test data generation functions don't handle relational dependencies.

#### 3. Explain

This is a pre-existing test data isolation issue. Each test generates unique IDs
but doesn't ensure that foreign key references point to existing records in the
database. The issue was masked when coverage was at 91.66% but revealed when all
tests ran after architecture changes.

#### 4. Resolve

1. Update test data generation functions to create parent records before child
   records
2. Use test fixtures or factory patterns to handle relational data setup
3. Ensure proper test isolation with database transactions or cleanup

#### 5. Fix

[Pending implementation]
