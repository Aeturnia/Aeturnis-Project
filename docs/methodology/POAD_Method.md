Prompt-Orchestrated AI Development (POAD): A Multi-Agent System for Human-Guided, AI-Driven Software Generation

Abstract
POAD is a structured methodology and software development system in which a human orchestrator coordinates multiple specialized AI agents through prompt chains and defined roles to iteratively generate, implement, validate, and deploy software systems. It introduces a repeatable, modular workflow that enables AI to act as planner, engineer, and QA auditor in a self-reinforcing loop, using natural language prompts as the primary interface.

🧩 Step 3: Core Components
1. Orchestration Layer
Human-provided prompts and commands

Maintains prompt history and execution context

Directs flow between Planner, Engineer, and QA layers

2. Planner AI (Claude)
Interprets high-level goals into scoped software prompts

Defines API-first contracts and system responsibilities

Generates modular, domain-specific implementation plans

3. Engineer AI (Replit Agent)
Converts prompts into executable code

Follows a pluggable template (service/controller/repo pattern)

Commits implementation reports and patch notes

4. QA/Architect AI (ChatGPT)
Validates Claude’s prompts for clarity, security, and alignment

Audits code from Replit for correctness, errors, and violations

Suggests refactors or supplemental patches

Maintains the integration log and glossary

5. Prompt Tracker
Logs all prompt sequences with IDs, timestamps, agents involved, and outcomes

Version-control compatible (e.g. prompt_tracker.md)

🔄 Step 4: Lifecycle Stages
Stage	Description
Prompt Creation	Human defines a task and sends it to Claude
Prompt Generation	Claude generates a scoped implementation prompt
Execution	Replit Agent executes and returns implementation report
QA Review	ChatGPT validates implementation and suggests changes
Patch/Retry	Prompt is modified and sent back (if needed)
Commit & Advance	Validated code is merged; tracker updated

⚙️ Step 5: Key Innovations
Feature	Novelty
Multi-Agent Role Specialization	Claude/ChatGPT/Replit assigned non-overlapping tasks
Human-Curated Prompt Chain	Prompt chain versioning + human approval at each gate
Prompt-First, API-Driven Dev Loop	Builds interfaces and mocks before functionality
Audit-First QA Enforcement	QA agent prevents flawed or ambiguous code from being merged
Structured Prompt Tracker	Acts like a commit log but for prompt-based systems

🧪 Step 6: Technical Claims (Draft)
A method for software development comprising:

A human operator issuing a prompt to a planning AI;

The planning AI generating a scoped software instruction for an engineering AI;

The engineering AI producing code in response to said instruction;

A third AI agent auditing and reviewing the resulting code for accuracy and integrity;

The process repeating iteratively until all QA criteria are met.

A system where natural language prompts act as the primary software orchestration interface, coordinating AI agents in distinct roles.

A logging mechanism that tracks prompt IDs, source agents, and outcomes as a form of versioned execution history.
