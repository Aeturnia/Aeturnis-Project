## 1  Summary

| Status | Area                                                                     | Notes |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| ✅     | **Branch compiles & lints** – CI “build” and “lint” jobs green           |
| ⚠️     | **Tests pass but coverage ≈ 10 %** – only placeholder tests present      |
| ❌     | **Controller / Service / Repository stubs missing** – directories empty  |
| ⚠️     | **Express bootstrap skeletal** – `src/index.ts` contains TODOs           |
| ⚠️     | **Shared package skeletal** – only exports `GAME_VERSION` constant       |
| ✅     | **Prisma schema valid** – 6 models with FK & index constraints           |
| ✅     | **Monorepo wiring correct** – pnpm workspaces and scripts compile        |
| ✅     | **CI workflow complete** – Postgres service, caching and coverage upload |

Legend: ✅ completed ⚠️ partial / improvement needed ❌ missing

## 2  Detailed Findings

### 2.1 Layer scaffolding

- **Missing directories**: `controllers/`, `repositories/`, `middleware/`
  (F‑1/F‑2 from audit).
- **Impact**: Later steps will have merge conflicts; new devs lack guidance.

### 2.2 Express bootstrap

- `src/index.ts` exists but only includes TODO comments.
- No health route, no Prisma connect, no global error handler.

### 2.3 Testing & Coverage

- Vitest job passes, but total coverage dropped to ~10 % after architecture
  merge.
- No unit or integration tests for newly‑added modules.

### 2.4 Security Middleware

- Not yet started – relevant as next step is **[P1‑S1‑2] Security & Auth**.

## 3  Recommendations

| Priority | Task                                                                                                        | Est. time |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **P0**   | Commit `.gitkeep` or placeholder files for missing dirs                                                     | 5 min     |
| **P0**   | Flesh out `src/index.ts` – basic Express, `/health`, error handler                                          | 30 min    |
| **P1**   | Add 3 sanity unit tests (constants, event‑bus) and one supertest for `/health`; raise coverage gate to 30 % | 1 h       |
| **P1**   | Enforce “changed‑files ≥ 80 % coverage” CI rule                                                             | 15 min    |
| **P2**   | Scaffold security middleware stubs (authCheck, rateLimiter, zodValidator)                                   | 1 h       |

## 4  Go / No‑Go Verdict

> **Merge after P0 items are addressed.** The branch compiles, lints, and seeds
> the schema, but without minimal scaffolding and bootstrap it leaves `main`
> non‑runnable. Fixing the P0 gaps (≤ 1 hour total) preserves project velocity
> and prevents future merge pain.

Once merged, proceed directly to **[P1‑S1‑2] Security & Auth**, keeping
test‑coverage improvements and middleware skeleton as parallel tasks.
