# Implementation Report: Initial DB Schema & Migrations

**Report ID:** IR-P1-S1-3_db-schema-migrations_server-v1.0.0_client-v1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-07-13  
**Server Version:** v1.0.0  
**Client Version:** v1.0.0  
**Phase/Step:** Phase 1 ‚Äì Step 3: Initial DB Schema & Migrations  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## 1. Executive Summary

- Implemented comprehensive Prisma schema for Phase 1 game entities
- Created 6 core models: Account, Character, BankAccount, Transaction, XpLedger,
  PkKillLog
- Set up Prisma client singleton pattern for optimal connection management
- Prepared seed script with realistic test data
- Established proper relationships, indexes, and constraints

## 2. Technical Details

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Key files created**:
  - `packages/server/prisma/schema.prisma` - Complete database schema
  - `packages/server/src/lib/prisma.ts` - Prisma client singleton
  - `packages/server/prisma/seed.ts` - Seed data script
  - `packages/server/.env.example` - Environment template
- **Schema Features**:
  - UUID primary keys using cuid()
  - Proper foreign key constraints with cascade deletes
  - Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields
  - Timestamps for audit trails
  - Soft delete support on Character model

## 3. Database Models

### Account

- User authentication and account management
- Fields: id, email, hashedPassword, createdAt, updatedAt, lastLoginAt, isActive
- Relations: One-to-many with Character

### Character

- Player character data
- Fields: id, accountId, name, level, experience, gold, alignment, timestamps,
  isDeleted
- Relations: Account (parent), BankAccount (one-to-one), Transactions, XpLedger,
  PkKillLog
- Indexes: accountId, name (unique), level

### BankAccount

- Character's bank storage (critical for death penalty system)
- Fields: id, characterId, balance, lastBankedAt, timestamps
- Relations: Character (one-to-one)

### Transaction

- Banking operation history
- Fields: id, characterId, amount, type (enum), description, timestamp
- Types: DEPOSIT, WITHDRAWAL, INTEREST, FEE, DEATH_PENALTY

### XpLedger

- Experience point tracking and audit trail
- Fields: id, characterId, xpChange (¬±), reason, timestamp
- Supports both gains and losses (death penalty -20%)

### PkKillLog

- Player-versus-player kill tracking
- Fields: id, killerId, victimId, timestamp, zoneId
- Relations: Character (killer and victim)
- Critical for PK cooldown system (10-min, 6/hour limit)

## 4. Migration Commands

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
cd packages/server
pnpm prisma:generate

# Create initial migration
pnpm prisma:migrate dev --name init_phase1

# Seed database
pnpm prisma:seed

# View database in Prisma Studio
pnpm prisma:studio
```

## 5. Seed Data

- 2 test accounts with bcrypt-hashed passwords
- 3 characters with varying levels and alignments
- Bank accounts with different balances
- Sample transactions showing deposits
- XP ledger entries including death penalties
- PK kill logs for testing cooldown system

## 6. Security Considerations

- Passwords hashed with bcryptjs (10 rounds)
- Email uniqueness enforced at database level
- Cascade deletes prevent orphaned records
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration

## 7. Next Steps

- Implement authentication service using these models
- Create banking service with transaction logic
- Build PK cooldown tracker using Redis + PkKillLog
- Add character creation endpoints
- Implement death penalty system

## 8. Production Database Configuration

**Date:** 2025-07-13  
**Provider:** Neon (PostgreSQL-compatible serverless)  
**Region:** US East 2 (AWS)  
**SSL:** Required (`sslmode=require`)

Database has been provisioned and is ready for use. Connection details are
securely stored in GitHub Secrets as `DATABASE_URL`. See
`docs/guides/database-setup.md` and `docs/guides/github-secrets-setup.md` for
configuration instructions.

## 9. DDERF Tickets

None identified. Schema properly supports all Phase 1 requirements including:

- ‚úÖ Banking system for death penalty
- ‚úÖ XP tracking with loss support
- ‚úÖ PK kill logging for cooldown
- ‚úÖ Account/character separation
- ‚úÖ Alignment tracking (-1000 to +1000)

pnpm test:coverage
pnpm build
```

## 9. Test Coverage Update

**Date:** 2025-07-13  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Coverage thresholds met

### Coverage Statistics

- **Server Package:** 91.66% line coverage
  - `prisma.ts`: 91.66% (missing only process.on handler)
  - All functions: 100% coverage
  - All branches: 100% coverage
- **Client Package:** 100% coverage across all metrics
  - `main.tsx`: 100% coverage
- **Shared Package:** 100% coverage across all metrics
  - `index.ts`: 100% coverage

### Test Files Added

- `packages/server/src/__tests__/lib/prisma.test.ts` - Prisma client singleton
  tests
- `packages/client/src/main.test.tsx` - Client entry point tests
- Enhanced test configurations with coverage thresholds:
  - Statements: 90%
  - Branches: 80%
  - Functions: 85%
  - Lines: 90%

### Build Configuration Updates

- Created `tsconfig.eslint.json` files for each package to handle test files
- Excluded test files from TypeScript build compilation
- Fixed ESLint configuration to properly parse test files
- All packages now build successfully with `pnpm build`
- Lint passes without errors using `pnpm lint`

### Testing Policy

As per project standards, comprehensive testing with Vitest is now **mandatory**
after every implementation step. All new features must include:

- Unit tests with minimum 90% line coverage
- Integration tests where applicable
- Test files committed with implementation code
- Coverage reports in implementation reports

All packages now meet or exceed the required coverage thresholds.
