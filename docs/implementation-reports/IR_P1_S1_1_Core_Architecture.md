# Implementation Report: Core Architecture Definition

**Catalog Tag:** [P1-S1-1]  
**Feature:** Core Architecture Definition  
**Implementation Date:** 2025-07-13  
**Agent:** Claude Code (Backend Specialist)  
**Branch:** feat/P1-S1-1  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

## Overview

This implementation establishes the foundational backend architecture for
Aeturnis Online Phase 1 MVP. The architecture defines service boundaries,
communication patterns, directory structure, and type definitions necessary for
systematic development of game features.

## Implementation Summary

### âœ… Completed Components

#### 1. Architecture Documentation

- **File:** `docs/architecture/core_architecture_overview.md`
- **Content:** Comprehensive architecture specification including:
  - 6 core services (Auth, Banking, Character, Combat, PK, XP)
  - Service communication patterns (sync/async)
  - Data consistency boundaries
  - Technology stack decisions

#### 2. Directory Structure

- **Created:** Complete `packages/server/src/` folder hierarchy
- **Structure:**
  ```
  packages/server/src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/          # HTTP route handlers
  â”œâ”€â”€ services/            # Business logic layer
  â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/        # Data access layer
  â”œâ”€â”€ types/              # TypeScript interfaces
  â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/         # Express middleware
  â”œâ”€â”€ routes/             # Route definitions
  â”œâ”€â”€ events/             # Event system
  â””â”€â”€ utils/              # Utility functions
  ```

#### 3. TypeScript Type Definitions

- **Auth Types:** `src/types/auth.types.ts` - Authentication interfaces
- **Banking Types:** `src/types/banking.types.ts` - Banking operation types
- **Character Types:** `src/types/character.types.ts` - Character management
  types
- **Combat Types:** `src/types/combat.types.ts` - Death/respawn mechanics
- **Common Types:** `src/types/common.types.ts` - Shared interfaces

#### 4. Event System Architecture

- **Event Bus:** `src/events/eventBus.ts` - Type-safe event emitter singleton
- **Event Types:** `src/events/events.types.ts` - Comprehensive event
  definitions
- **Features:**
  - Type-safe event emission and listening
  - Automatic audit trail for critical events
  - Health checks and graceful shutdown
  - Error handling for failed event emissions

#### 5. Game Constants

- **File:** `src/utils/constants.ts`
- **Content:** Game mechanics constants including:
  - Character limits (3 per account)
  - PvP constraints (10-min cooldown, 6 kills/hour)
  - Death penalties (100% unbanked gold, 20% XP)
  - Alignment ranges (-1000 to +1000)
  - Security and API configuration

#### 6. Service Placeholders

Created service classes with TODO markers for implementation:

- **AuthService:** User authentication and session management
- **BankingService:** Critical for death penalty system
- **CharacterService:** Character lifecycle management
- **CombatService:** Death/respawn processing
- **PKService:** PvP mechanics and alignment
- **XPService:** Experience and level management

#### 7. Route Placeholders

Created route constant definitions for all major API endpoints:

- Authentication routes (register, login, logout, profile)
- Banking routes (deposit, withdraw, balance, transactions)
- Character routes (CRUD operations)
- Combat routes (death, respawn, status)
- PK routes (kill recording, history, cooldowns)

## Architecture Decisions

### Service Communication Model

- **Pattern:** Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository â†’ Database
- **Communication:** HTTP for external, EventEmitter for internal
- **Consistency:** Transactional boundaries for critical operations

### Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Express.js with TypeScript
- **Validation:** Zod schemas for type safety
- **Events:** Node.js EventEmitter with type safety
- **Security:** bcrypt, JWT, rate limiting
- **Logging:** Winston structured logging

### Database Integration

- **ORM:** Prisma with existing 6-model schema
- **Mapping:** Each service mapped to specific models
- **Transactions:** Defined boundaries for atomic operations

## Service Responsibilities

### 1. AuthService â†” Account Model

- User registration/login operations
- JWT session management
- Account metadata tracking

### 2. BankingService â†” BankAccount + Transaction Models

- Gold deposit/withdrawal operations
- Transaction logging and history
- Critical for death penalty gold loss

### 3. CharacterService â†” Character Model

- Character CRUD operations
- Multi-character account management
- Auto-deletion policy enforcement

### 4. CombatService â†” Character + Transaction + XpLedger Models

- Death penalty processing (lose unbanked gold + 20% XP)
- Respawn mechanics and resurrection sickness
- Cross-service coordination for death consequences

### 5. PKService â†” PkKillLog + Character Models

- PvP kill tracking and validation
- Alignment management (-1000 to +1000)
- Cooldown enforcement (10 min, 6 kills/hour)

### 6. XPService â†” XpLedger + Character Models

- Experience gain/loss calculations
- Level progression tracking
- Death penalty XP loss processing

## Implementation Notes

### What's Ready

- âœ… Complete architectural foundation
- âœ… Type-safe interfaces and contracts
- âœ… Directory structure and organization
- âœ… Event system infrastructure
- âœ… Service boundaries and responsibilities

### What's Next

- ðŸ”„ Service implementation (starting with BankingService)
- ðŸ”„ Express server setup and middleware
- ðŸ”„ Repository layer implementation
- ðŸ”„ API route implementations
- ðŸ”„ Comprehensive testing setup

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Service layer business logic (90%+ coverage required)
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end API testing
- **Test Data:** Isolated test databases with cleanup
- **Mocking:** External dependencies and event handlers

### Security Considerations

- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma
- Rate limiting on sensitive operations
- JWT token management and expiration
- Password strength enforcement

## Next Implementation Priority

1. **[P1-S7-1] Banking Service** - Critical for death penalties
2. **[P1-S2-1] Account Management** - Authentication foundation
3. **[P1-S7-2] Death & Respawn System** - Core game mechanic

## Conclusion

The core architecture is now fully defined and scaffolded. All service
boundaries, type definitions, communication patterns, and directory structures
are in place. This provides a solid foundation for parallel development of
individual services while maintaining consistency and type safety throughout the
codebase.

The architecture supports the critical game mechanics defined in the design
document, particularly the death penalty system that requires tight integration
between Banking, Combat, and XP services.

**Status:** Ready for service implementation phase
