## 1. Reference

- **Implementation Report:**
  `docs/implementation-reports/IR_P1_S1_2_GitHubActionsCI.md`
- **CI Workflow:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in `Aeturnis-Project` repository

## 2. Summary of IR Expectations

The IR specifies that the CI should:

- Use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` for dependency installation
- Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test --coverage`, and `pnpm build`
- Upload build artifacts for server and client
- Leverage caching for package manager and builds
- Clearly fail on lint, test, or build errors
- Document CI usage in `README.md`

## 3. Actual Implementation Findings

| IR Item                           | Status               | Notes                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dependency installation           | ✅ Implemented       | Uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`                       |
| Lint step                         | ✅ Implemented       | `pnpm lint` present                                         |
| Test step                         | ✅ Implemented       | `pnpm test --coverage` present                              |
| Build step                        | ✅ Implemented       | `pnpm build` present                                        |
| Artifact upload                   | ✅ Implemented       | `actions/upload-artifact` configured for `packages/*/dist`  |
| Caching                           | ❌ Partially missing | No `actions/cache` for PNPM store or Node modules detected  |
| Failure on errors                 | ✅ Implemented       | Jobs fail on lint/test/build exit codes                     |
| CI Documentation in README.md     | ❌ Not found         | README.md lacks local CI invocation instructions            |
| Environment secrets configuration | ❌ Not referenced    | Workflow does not reference `DATABASE_URL` or other secrets |

## 4. Recommendations

1. **Add Caching Steps**\
   Include `actions/cache@v3` to cache the PNPM store and node modules:

   ```yaml
   - name: Cache PNPM store
     uses: actions/cache@v3
     with:
       path: ~/.pnpm-store
       key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-${{ hashFiles('pnpm-lock.yaml') }}

   - name: Cache node modules
     uses: actions/cache@v3
     with:
       path: packages/**/node_modules
       key: ${{ runner.os }}-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
   ```

2. **Reference Environment Variables**\
   Declare required secrets and env vars in workflow:
   ```yaml
   env:
     DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
   ```
3. **Document CI Locally**\
   Update `README.md` with a “Running CI Locally” section, e.g., using `act` or
   a devcontainer.

## 5. Conclusion

The core CI pipeline aligns with the IR in terms of install, lint, test, build,
and artifact steps. However, caching and documentation need to be added to
optimize performance and developer experience. Adjusting these will bring the
implementation fully in line with the report and SOP conventions.
