**Date:** 2025-07-12

## 1. References

- **Implementation Report:**
  `docs/implementation-reports/IR_P1_S1_3_DB_Schema_Migrations.md`
- **Prisma Schema:** `packages/server/prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Migration Directory:** `prisma/migrations/`
- **Prisma Client Export:** `packages/server/src/lib/prisma.ts`
- **Seed Script:** `prisma/seed.ts`

## 2. IR Expectations

The IR specifies that the implementation should include:

1. **Prisma models** for Account, Character, BankAccount, Transaction, XpLedger,
   PkKillLog.
2. **Initial migration** via `prisma migrate dev --name init_phase1` with
   correct SQL (FKs, indexes).
3. **PrismaClient export** in `lib/prisma.ts` for type-safe access.
4. **Seed script** populating sample Account & Character records.
5. **Implementation Report** in
   `docs/implementation-reports/IR_P1_S1_3_DB_Schema_Migrations.md`.
6. **Vitest tests** for basic CRUD operations (per later extension).

## 3. Actual Implementation Findings

| Item                           | Status             | Notes                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prisma models                  | ✅ Implemented     | `schema.prisma` defines all six models with correct fields.                                       |
| Initial migration files        | ✅ Implemented     | One migration folder `init_phase1` exists with SQL DDL.                                           |
| Foreign keys & indexes         | ✅ Implemented     | Migration SQL includes FKs between Character→Account, etc.                                        |
| PrismaClient export            | ✅ Implemented     | `packages/server/src/lib/prisma.ts` exports configured client.                                    |
| Seed script                    | ⚠️ Partial         | `prisma/seed.ts` seeds `Account` and `Character`, but omits `BankAccount` and `XpLedger` entries. |
| Implementation Report document | ❌ Not found       | IR file missing or not located at expected path.                                                  |
| Vitest CRUD tests              | ❌ Not implemented | No tests detected under `packages/server/src/__tests__/`.                                         |

## 4. Recommendations

1. **Seed Script Enhancement**: Extend `prisma/seed.ts` to include sample data
   for `BankAccount`, `Transaction`, and `XpLedger` to support end-to-end
   testing.
2. **Implementation Report**: Create or move
   `IR_P1_S1_3_DB_Schema_Migrations.md` into the docs repo under
   `docs/implementation-reports/` to satisfy reporting requirements.
3. **Add Vitest Tests**: Add basic CRUD tests in `__tests__` for each Prisma
   model to validate schema correctness and increase coverage.

## 5. Conclusion

The core schema and migration setup aligns well with specifications, but the
seed data and documentation/reporting are incomplete. Addressing the above
recommendations will fully conform to the IR and strengthen development support
for subsequent features.
